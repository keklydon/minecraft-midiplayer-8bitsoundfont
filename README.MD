# minecraft-midiplayer-8bitsoundfont

This is an 8bit-like soundfont for SBPrime's excellent MidiPlayer plugin for Minecraft.
In order to use this resource pack correctly, if you're the server administrator make sure that both the files 'gm.map' and 'gm.drum' are located in the /MidiPlayer/ folder.
Also make sure that these two files are correctly configured in MidiPlayers config.yml
